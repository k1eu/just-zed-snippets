# Just TS Snippets for Zed

This is a monorepo for the `Just * snippets` series of snippets for the Zed editor


## History

I have created [just-vscode-snippets](https://github.com/k1eu/just-vscode-snippets) because other snippets
were really bloated and didn't follow Keep It Simple movement. This is a port of them for Zed Editor.

## Instalation
Copy files / or their contents inside the Zed Snippets directory (default: ~/.config/zed/snippets)
You can use "snippets: open folder" from command palette in Zed for easier access.
File names are mandatory since that's how they show in correct language.
